# Stock-Prices-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning

## Overview
This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal of this project is to develop models that can forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

## Introduction 
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the complex nature of financial markets. In this project, we explore different approaches to predict stock prices, ranging from traditional machine learning algorithms to deep learning models.

About LSTM
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial neural network used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network (RNN) can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). This characteristic makes LSTM networks ideal for processing and predicting data. For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, robot control, video games, and healthcare

## Models
This project includes the following models for stock price prediction:

- Linear Regression: A foundational regression technique used to predict stock prices based on historical data trends, assuming a linear relationship between features and target variable.

- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN): A versatile machine learning algorithm that determines predictions by identifying the closest data points in the feature space, providing simplicity and adaptability in analyzing similarities between new and existing data instances.
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it well-suited for capturing complex patterns in stock price movements over time.






## Results
We evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE). The result is also attached in python file .
