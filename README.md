Introduction
Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the complex nature of financial markets. In this project, we explore different approaches to predict stock prices, ranging from traditional machine learning algorithms to deep learning models.

Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Keras
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras
Usage
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd stock-price-prediction
Run the main script:
bash
Copy code
python predict.py
This script will train the models and generate predictions for stock prices.

Models
This project includes the following models for stock price prediction:

Linear Regression: A basic regression model trained on historical stock data.

Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that uses decision trees for regression.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its ability to process sequences of data.

CNN-LSTM: A hybrid model combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and LSTMs for improved performance.

Results
We evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE). Detailed results and analysis can be found in the results directory.
